# download snort 2.0 v then its latest rules by login by temp email
# then also npcap free edition then check only below 2 check boxex and install 
#then download note c++
# then extract rules by 7zip
# then copy (rules and preproc rules)folders from rules extracted files to main snort folder
# then open etc folder and open snort.conf and open that in npc++
#then start config (and this is very much big process imean lengthy but not one when you do so)
#then we got three config stage 
# first is snort.conf then black.list & white.list as register & and your alerts custome rules as local.rules
# after that you can use terminal with admin 
#first go to main c folder then Snort (that is where snort is downloaded defaultly)
# by using that directory you can use "snort -w" by this command you can get all tha commands
# but for starters use commands are below
# 1.find your ip and network adapter name by ipconfig in terminal
#2. then rember and type "snort -W" you only need to find that found index number 
# 3. then type "snort -i (yourindexnumber) -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -T " this will test your config file
#4. then type same but with -A console "snort -i (yourindexnumber) -c c:\Snort\etc\snort.conf -A console " this will show your custome messeges
#5.then for clr or to stop and generelize summery use "cltr+c"

#that's all you only touch only tips of the iceberg but it will enough for the practicals! ;)
